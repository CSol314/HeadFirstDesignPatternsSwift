    // A MallardDuck uses the Quack class to handle its quack, so when performQuack() is called, the responsibility for the quack is delegated to the Quack object and we get a real quack.
    // And it uses FlyWithWings as its FlyBehavior type.
    // Remember, MallardDuck inherits the quackBehavior and flyBehavior instance variables from class Duck.
