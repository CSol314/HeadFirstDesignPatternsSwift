// IN SWIFT: we create a base class to store the new speed.
// IN SWIFT: we won't create individual command classes for setting the speed or turning the fan off. This has a consequence of exposing CeilingFan.Speed to clients, but we might make this tradeoff to reduce the overall number of command classes.
