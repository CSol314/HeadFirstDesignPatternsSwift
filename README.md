# Head First Design Patterns in Swift
This repository contains sample code in Swift based on the book, "[Head First Design Patterns](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596007126.do)", by Freeman & Robson, published by O'Reilly.

This code has been developed as part of a **Book Club** I am running with members of my team.

The original sample code in Java, which the book's examples are based on, can be found here: https://github.com/bethrobson/Head-First-Design-Patterns.

* Each chapter has its own Swift Playground illustrating the evolution of sample code into one or two design patterns.
* Each Playground page represends a step in the evolution of a design pattern, or a variation.
* The final Playground page for each chapter includes Swift source files.

## Chapters:
* Strategy Pattern
* Observer Pattern
* Decorator Pattern
* Factory Pattern
* Singleton Pattern
* Command Pattern
* Adapter and Fa√ßade
* Template Method
* Iterator and Composite
